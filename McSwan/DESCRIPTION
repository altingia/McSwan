Description: The Multiple-Collision Coalescent Analyser (McSwan) is a genome scan which allows (i) the identification of genomic regions which have recently experienced a selective sweep from single standing variant (in single or multiple populations) and (ii) the subsequent dating of the detected sweeps, assuming a molecular clock. It implements an approximate Bayesian computation framework to compare neutral/selective models and estimate sweep ages, on the basis of multi-dimensional joint site frequency spectra as summary statistics.
